# Image Evolution
A project using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create images through the process of mutation and evolution. <br/>
Check out the project [here!](https://teihek.github.io/CMPM147-P5/)

# Design parameter choices
## Theme "Flower"
- Petal count and size: Varies depending the individual flower
- Petal and center color <br/>

## Theme "Sakura"
- Small branches: Position on larger branches and ends vary
- Flower size, count, and flower : branch ratio: Shows variation of different trees
- Petal count: These trees let loose a lot of petals <br/>

## Theme "Mountains"
- Mountain position and size: Shows variations of mountains seen elsewhere
- Color alpha: I was trying to use this to create an effect where mountains in the distance would appear more blue, but I don't think it turned out the way I wanted it to. <br/>

# Approach to mutation
From my limited understanding from the assignment, the mutations allow for more change with each iteration of the image. A higher mutation value allows for a higher range of design parameter possibilites. <br/>

# Artist statement
To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what I wanted out of this project, and I don't think I can say that I met those goals as a result.
The project was quite time consuming since I was ensuring that my code would work, but artisically speaking, I had to simplify a lot since the already enlarged canvas size did not allow for fine details. <br/>
What worked: I created some images given the starter code. <br/>
What didn't work: I don't think I got the right guidance, and there was not a working code example, so I did the assignment in a way that made sense to me.
